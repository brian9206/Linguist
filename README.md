# Linguist
A simple chat translator for FFXIV Dalamud. ChatTranslator is outdated and Echoglossian never works on my side so I made this for myself.

## Installation
1. `/xlplugins`
2. Go to "Experimental"
3. Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brian9206/Linguist/main/repo.json` into the last empty entry of "Custom Plugin Repositories"
4. Make sure it is enabled
5. Install the plugin
